                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>ClearSource helps communities easily access and understand information about local water quality. We take complex scientific data from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and present it in a simple, user-friendly format.</p>

                <h3>Understanding Water Quality</h3>
                <p><strong>pH Level:</strong> This measures how acidic or alkaline water is on a 0-14 scale. Safe drinking water falls between 6.5 and 8.5, with 7 being neutral. If pH drops below 6.5, the water becomes acidic and may corrode pipes. When it rises above 8.5, you might notice a bitter taste.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Temperature:</strong> Most healthy aquatic ecosystems thrive between 50-77°F (10-25°C). Extreme readings, whether below freezing or above 85°F, can stress wildlife and may signal environmental problems.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Discharge:</strong> Think of this as the river's flow rate, measured in cubic feet per second. What's "normal" varies dramatically by location and season. A sudden spike might mean flooding or heavy rain upstream, while a drop could indicate drought. Compare current readings to that site's historical averages to know if something's unusual.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Turbidity:</strong> This tells you how clear the water is. Crystal-clear water measures below 5 NTU (Nephelometric Turbidity Units). Readings between 5-50 show some cloudiness. Anything above 50 suggests high pollution, sediment, or algae: and the water may not be safe.</p>

                <h3>Our Data Source</h3>
                <p>All water quality data comes from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Water Services API. The USGS operates thousands of monitoring stations across the United States, collecting real-time data on water conditions.</p>

                <p><span class="badge moderate">Yellow (Moderate)</span> Water quality shows some concern, use caution</p>
